  abstract = {This work is concerned with determination of the steady-state structure of time-independent Lindblad master equations, especially those possessing more than one steady state. The approach here is to treat Lindblad systems as generalizations of unitary quantum mechanics, extending the intuition of symmetries and conserved quantities to the dissipative case. We combine and apply various results to obtain an exhaustive characterization of the infinite-time behavior of Lindblad evolution, including both the structure of the infinite-time density matrix and its dependence on initial conditions. The effect of the environment in the infinite-time limit can therefore be tracked exactly for arbitrary state initialization and without knowledge of dynamics at intermediate time. As a consequence, sufficient criteria for determining the steady state of a Lindblad master equation are obtained. These criteria are knowledge of the initial state, a basis for the steady-state subspace, and all conserved quantities. We give examples of two-qubit dissipation and single-mode d-photon absorption where all quantities are determined analytically. Applications of these techniques to quantum information, computation, and feedback control are discussed.},

  abstract = {Recent works have shown that generic local Hamiltonians can be efficiently inferred from local measurements performed on their eigenstates or thermal states. Realistic quantum systems are often affected by dissipation and decoherence due to coupling to an external environment. This raises the question whether the steady states of such open quantum systems contain sufficient information allowing for full and efficient reconstruction of the system’s dynamics. We find that such a reconstruction is possible for generic local Markovian dynamics. We propose a recovery method that uses only local measurements; for systems with finite-range interactions, the method recovers the Lindbladian acting on each spatial domain using only observables within that domain. We numerically study the accuracy of the reconstruction as a function of the number of measurements, type of open-system dynamics and system size. Interestingly, we show that couplings to external environments can in fact facilitate the reconstruction of Hamiltonians composed of commuting terms.},

  abstract = {Linear dynamical systems are the foundational statistical model upon which control theory is built. Both the celebrated Kalman filter and the linear quadratic regulator require knowledge of the system dynamics to provide analytic guarantees. Naturally, learning the dynamics of a linear dynamical system from linear measurements has been intensively studied since Rudolph Kalman's pioneering work in the 1960's. Towards these ends, we provide the first polynomial time algorithm for learning a linear dynamical system from a polynomial length trajectory up to polynomial error in the system parameters under essentially minimal assumptions: observability, controllability, and marginal stability. Our algorithm is built on a method of moments estimator to directly estimate Markov parameters from which the dynamics can be extracted. Furthermore, we provide statistical lower bounds when our observability and controllability assumptions are violated.},

We show that a unitary map on a \$d\$-level system is completely characterized by a minimal set of \$d\^{}2\{+\}d\$ elements associated with a collection of POVMs, in contrast to the \$d\^{}4\{-\}d\^{}2\$ elements required for a general completely positive trace-preserving map. To achieve this lower bound, one must probe the map with a particular set of \$d\$ pure states. We further compare the performance of different compressed sensing algorithms used to reconstruct a near-unitary process from such data. We find that when we have accurate prior information, an appropriate compressed sensing method reduces the required data needed for high-fidelity estimation, and different estimators applied to the same data are sensitive to different types of noise. Compressed sensing techniques can therefore be used both as indicators of error models and to validate the use of the prior assumptions.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a novel algorithm to approximate the matrix with minimum nuclear norm among all matrices obeying a set of convex constraints. This problem may be understood as the convex relaxation of a rank minimization problem, and arises in many important applications as in the task of recovering a large matrix from a small subset of its entries (the famous Netflix problem). Off-the-shelf algorithms such as interior point methods are not directly amenable to large problems of this kind with over a million unknown entries. This paper develops a simple first-order and easy-to-implement algorithm that is extremely efficient at addressing problems in which the optimal solution has low rank. The algorithm is iterative and produces a sequence of matrices (X\^{}k, Y\^{}k) and at each step, mainly performs a soft-thresholding operation on the singular values of the matrix Y\^{}k. There are two remarkable features making this attractive for low-rank matrix completion problems. The first is that the soft-thresholding operation is applied to a sparse matrix; the second is that the rank of the iterates X\^{}k is empirically nondecreasing. Both these facts allow the algorithm to make use of very minimal storage space and keep the computational cost of each iteration low. We provide numerical examples in which 1,000 by 1,000 matrices are recovered in less than a minute on a modest desktop computer. We also demonstrate that our approach is amenable to very large scale problems by recovering matrices of rank about 10 with nearly a billion unknowns from just about 0.4\% of their sampled entries. Our methods are connected with linearized Bregman iterations for l1 minimization, and we develop a framework in which one can understand these algorithms in terms of well-known Lagrange multiplier algorithms.},

This discovery can save the cost of computation, and accelerate the converging process when taking the average over noisy trajectories. As a result, our method can be widely applied to many open quantum models, especially large-scale systems and extend the quantum regression theory to the non-Markovian case. In the short-time simulations, it is observed a significant difference between Markovian and non-Markovian cases, which can be applied to realize the environmental spectrum detection and enhance the measurement sensitivity in varying open quantum systems.},

We show that the accurate application of the partial secular approximation in the derivation of the Bloch-Redfield master equation naturally induces a symmetry on the superoperator level, which may greatly reduce the complexity of the master equation by decomposing the Liouvillian superoperator into independent blocks. Moreover, we prove that, if the steady state of the system is unique, one single block contains all the information about it, and that this imposes a constraint on the possible steady-state coherences of the unique state, ruling out some of them. To provide some examples, we show how the symmetry appears for two coupled spins interacting with separate baths, as well as for two harmonic oscillators immersed in a common environment. In both cases the standard derivation and solution of the master equation is simplified, as well as the search for the steady state. The block diagonalization does not appear when a local master equation is chosen.},

  abstract = {Tensor CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition is a powerful but computationally challenging tool in modern data analytics. In this paper, we show ways of sampling intermediate steps of alternating minimization algorithms for computing low rank tensor CP decompositions, leading to the sparse alternating least squares (SPALS) method. Specifically, we sample the the Khatri-Rao product, which arises as an intermediate object during the iterations of alternating least squares. This product captures the interactions between different tensor modes, and form the main computational bottleneck for solving many tensor related tasks. By exploiting the spectral structures of the matrix Khatri-Rao product, we provide efficient access to its statistical leverage scores. When applied to the tensor CP decomposition, our method leads to the first algorithm that runs in sublinear time per-iteration and approximates the output of deterministic alternating least squares algorithms. Empirical evaluations of this approach show significantly speedups over existing randomized and deterministic routines for performing CP decomposition. On a tensor of the size 2.4m by 6.6m by 92k with over 2 billion nonzeros formed by Amazon product reviews, our routine converges in two minutes to the same error as deterministic ALS.},

  abstract = {There has been significant interest in understanding how practical constraints on contemporary quantum devices impact the complexity of quantum learning. For the classic question of tomography, recent work tightly characterized the copy complexity for any protocol that can only measure one copy of the unknown state at a time, showing it is polynomially worse than if one can make fully-entangled measurements. While we now have a fairly complete picture of the rates for such tasks in the near-term and fault-tolerant regimes, it remains poorly understood what the landscape in between looks like. In this work, we study tomography in the natural setting where one can make measurements of \$t\$ copies at a time. For sufficiently small \$\textbackslash epsilon\$, we show that for any \$t \textbackslash le d\^{}2\$, \$\textbackslash widetilde\{\textbackslash Theta\}(\textbackslash frac\{d\^{}3\}\{\textbackslash sqrt\{t\}\textbackslash epsilon\^{}2\})\$ copies are necessary and sufficient to learn an unknown \$d\$-dimensional state \$\textbackslash rho\$ to trace distance \$\textbackslash epsilon\$. This gives a smooth and optimal interpolation between the known rates for single-copy and fully-entangled measurements. To our knowledge, this is the first smooth entanglement-copy tradeoff known for any quantum learning task, and for tomography, no intermediate point on this curve was known, even at \$t = 2\$. An important obstacle is that unlike the optimal single-copy protocol, the optimal fully-entangled protocol is inherently biased and thus precludes naive batching approaches. Instead, we devise a novel two-stage procedure that uses Keyl's algorithm to refine a crude estimate for \$\textbackslash rho\$ based on single-copy measurements. A key insight is to use Schur-Weyl sampling not to estimate the spectrum of \$\textbackslash rho\$, but to estimate the deviation of \$\textbackslash rho\$ from the maximally mixed state. When \$\textbackslash rho\$ is far from the maximally mixed state, we devise a novel quantum splitting procedure that reduces to the case where \$\textbackslash rho\$ is close to maximally mixed.},

It can learn to generate such measurement data and extrapolate outside of its training region that satisfies the von Neumann and time-local Lindblad master equations for closed and open quantum systems respectively in an unsupervised means. Furthermore, the QNODE rediscovers quantum mechanical laws such as the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in a data-driven way, without any constraint or guidance. Additionally, we show that trajectories that are generated from the QNODE that are close in its latent space have similar quantum dynamics while preserving the physics of the training system.},

Our techniques combine leverage score sampling and iterative methods. By extending our approach to block-design matrices where one block is a Kronecker product, we also achieve subquadratic-time algorithms for (1) Kronecker ridge regression and (2) updating the factor matrices of a Tucker decomposition in ALS, which is not a pure Kronecker regression problem, thereby improving the running time of all steps of Tucker ALS. We demonstrate the speed and accuracy of this Kronecker regression algorithm on synthetic data and real-world image tensors.},

  abstract = {Intuitively, if a density operator has small rank, then it should be easier to estimate from experimental data, since in this case only a few eigenvectors need to be learned. We prove two complementary results that confirm this intuition. Firstly, we show that a low-rank density matrix can be estimated using fewer copies of the state, i.e. the sample complexity of tomography decreases with the rank. Secondly, we show that unknown low-rank states can be reconstructed from an incomplete set of measurements, using techniques from compressed sensing and matrix completion. These techniques use simple Pauli measurements, and their output can be certified without making any assumptions about the unknown state. In this paper, we present a new theoretical analysis of compressed tomography, based on the restricted isometry property for low-rank matrices. Using these tools, we obtain near-optimal error bounds for the realistic situation where the data contain noise due to finite statistics, and the density matrix is full-rank with decaying eigenvalues. We also obtain upper bounds on the sample complexity of compressed tomography, and almost-matching lower bounds on the sample complexity of any procedure using adaptive sequences of Pauli measurements. Using numerical simulations, we compare the performance of two compressed sensing estimators—the matrix Dantzig selector and the matrix Lasso—with standard maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE). We find that, given comparable experimental resources, the compressed sensing estimators consistently produce higher fidelity state reconstructions than MLE. In addition, the use of an incomplete set of measurements leads to faster classical processing with no loss of accuracy. Finally, we show how to certify the accuracy of a low-rank estimate using direct fidelity estimation, and describe a method for compressed quantum process tomography that works for processes with small Kraus rank and requires only Pauli eigenstate preparations and Pauli measurements.},

This poses severe challenges in the efficient~control, calibration and validation~of quantum states and their dynamics. Although the full simulation of large-scale quantum systems may only be possible on a quantum computer, classical characterization and optimization methods still play an important role. Here, we review different approaches that use classical post-processing techniques, possibly combined with adaptive optimization, to learn quantum systems, their correlation properties, dynamics and interaction with the environment. We discuss theoretical proposals and successful implementations across different multiple-qubit architectures such as spin qubits, trapped ions, photonic and atomic systems, and superconducting circuits. This Review provides a brief background of key concepts recurring across many of these approaches with special emphasis on the~Bayesian formalism and neural networks.},

To allow a smooth tradeoff between the reduction in the number of parameters (to reduce estimation variance) and the accuracy of the covariance approximation (affecting estimation bias), we introduce a diagonally loaded modification of the sum-of-kronecker products representation in [1]. We derive an asymptotic Crame´r-Rao bound (CRB) on the minimum attainable mean squared predictor coefficient estimation error for unbiased estimators of Kronecker structured covariance matrices.

Our methods have several features that make them amenable to experimental implementation: they require only simple Pauli measurements, use fast convex optimization, are stable against noise, and can be applied to states that are only approximately low rank.

Anshu, Arunachalam, Kuwahara, and Soleimanifar [AAKS21] recently studied the sample complexity (number of copies of ρ needed) of this problem for geometrically local N-qubit Hamiltonians. In the high-temperature (low β) regime, their algorithm has sample complexity poly (N, 1/β, 1/ε) and can be implemented with polynomial, but suboptimal, time complexity. In this paper, we study the same question for a more general class of Hamiltonians. We show how to learn the coefficients of a Hamiltonian to error ε with sample complexity S=O(\textbackslash log N/(\textbackslash beta\textbackslash varepsilon)\textsuperscript{2}) and time complexity linear in the sample size, O(SN). Furthermore, we prove a matching lower bound showing that our algorithm’s sample complexity is optimal, and hence our time complexity is also optimal. In the appendix, we show that virtually the same algorithm can be used to learn H from a real-time evolution unitary e\textsuperscript{-i t H} in a small t regime with similar sample and time complexity.},

The key requirement on the measurement matrices is typically the restricted isometry property, that is, approximate orthonormality when acting on the subspace to be recovered. Among the most widely used random matrix measurement models are (a) independent subgaussian models and (b) randomized Fourier-based models, allowing for the efficient computation of the measurements. For the now ubiquitous tensor data, direct application of the known recovery algorithms to the vectorized or matricized tensor is memory-heavy because of the huge measurement matrices to be constructed and stored. In this paper, we propose modewise measurement schemes based on subgaussian and randomized Fourier measurements. These modewise operators act on the pairs or other small subsets of the tensor modes separately. They require significantly less memory than the measurements working on the vectorized tensor, provably satisfy the tensor restricted isometry property and experimentally can recover the tensor data from fewer measurements and do not require impractical storage.},

These two procedures are in some cases solving equivalent problems, but with quite different algorithms. In this article we bring the two approaches together, leading to an efficient algorithm for large matrix factorization and completion that outperforms both of these. We develop a software package "softImpute" in R for implementing our approaches, and a distributed version for very large matrices using the "Spark" cluster programming environment.},

The qubit used is two energy levels of the triplet state in the nitrogen vacancy defect in diamond. QPT is applied to a qubit which has been allowed to decohere for three different time periods. In each case, the process is found in terms of the χ matrix representation and the affine map representation. The discrepancy between experimentally estimated process and the closest physically valid process is noted. The results of QPT performed after three different decoherence times are used to find the error generators, or Lindblad operators, for the system, using the technique introduced by Boulant et al (2003 Phys.

  abstract = {Minimizing the rank of a matrix subject to affine constraints is a fundamental problem with many important applications in machine learning and statistics. In this paper we propose a simple and fast algorithm SVP (Singular Value Projection) for rank minimization under affine constraints ARMP and show that SVP recovers the minimum rank solution for affine constraints that satisfy a Restricted Isometry Property\vphantom\{\} (RIP). Our method guarantees geometric convergence rate even in the presence of noise and requires strictly weaker assumptions on the RIP constants than the existing methods. We also introduce a Newton-step for our SVP framework to speed-up the convergence with substantial empirical gains. Next, we address a practically important application of ARMP - the problem of low-rank matrix completion, for which the defining affine constraints do not directly obey RIP, hence the guarantees of SVP do not hold. However, we provide partial progress towards a proof of exact recovery for our algorithm by showing a more restricted isometry property and observe empirically that our algorithm recovers low-rank Incoherent matrices from an almost optimal number of uniformly sampled entries. We also demonstrate empirically that our algorithms outperform existing methods, such as those of \textbackslash cite\{CaiCS2008,LeeB2009b, KeshavanOM2009\}, for ARMP and the matrix completion problem by an order of magnitude and are also more robust to noise and sampling schemes. In particular, results show that our SVP-Newton method is significantly robust to noise and performs impressively on a more realistic power-law sampling scheme for the matrix completion problem.},

We here introduce an even more general model, namely the partial-trace regression model, a family of linear mappings from matrix-valued inputs to matrix-valued outputs; this model subsumes the trace regression model and thus the linear regression model. Borrowing tools from quantum information theory, where partial trace operators have been extensively studied, we propose a framework for learning partial trace regression models from data by taking advantage of the so-called low-rank Kraus representation of completely positive maps. We show the relevance of our framework with synthetic and real-world experiments conducted for both i) matrix-to-matrix regression and ii) positive semidefinite matrix completion, two tasks which can be formulated as partial trace regression problems.},

QDT requires no user knowledge of operator matrix assembly and automatically performs all necessary operator constructions and Hilbert space expansions. Density matrix propagation is performed by numerically solving the Liouville–von-Neumann equation. In order to simulate dissipation and decoherence effects, the Lindblad formalism is implemented. Furthermore, QDT supplies practical analysis and plotting functions, such as visualization of density matrix and expectation value dynamics, that facilitate the evaluation of simulation results. QDT further provides a module for the simulation of coherent multidimensional spectroscopy.

The simulation of the time evolution of these systems by numerically solving differential equations is not straightforward, however. Simulation code that is written from scratch is time-consuming to create and prone to errors during implementation. Furthermore, if code bases deviate drastically between research groups, reproducibility of results becomes challenging, and communication is hindered. Solution method: QDT addresses the above issues by providing a modular toolbox that contains, among others, elements for the simulation of multi-level quantum systems, quantum harmonic oscillators, their interaction with external electric fields, and dissipation. These elements can be combined by the user to build a specific system of interest. All operators are created and expanded automatically based on a single script file provided by the user. Simulation tasks are automated by a single function call, and parallelized in case of extensive tasks.},

  abstract = {Quantum process tomography is the task of reconstructing unknown quantum channels from measured data. In this work, we introduce compressed sensing-based methods that facilitate the reconstruction of quantum channels of low Kraus rank. Our main contribution is the analysis of a natural measurement model for this task: We assume that data is obtained by sending pure states into the channel and measuring expectation values on the output. Neither ancillary systems nor coherent operations across multiple channel uses are required. Most previous results on compressed process reconstruction reduce the problem to quantum state tomography on the channel's Choi matrix. While this ansatz yields recovery guarantees from an essentially minimal number of measurements, physical implementations of such schemes would typically involve ancillary systems. A priori, it is unclear whether a measurement model tailored directly to quantum process tomography might require more measurements. We establish that this is not the case. Technically, we prove recovery guarantees for three different reconstruction algorithms. The reconstructions are based on a trace, diamond, and \$\textbackslash ell\_2\$-norm minimization, respectively. Our recovery guarantees are uniform in the sense that with one random choice of measurement settings all quantum channels can be recovered equally well. Moreover, stability against arbitrary measurement noise and robustness against violations of the low-rank assumption is guaranteed. Numerical studies demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.},

This Spatio-Temporal Transition Operator Recovery problem is motivated by the recent interest in learning time-varying graph signals that are driven by graph operators depending on the underlying graph topology. We address the nonlinearity of the problem by embedding it into a higher-dimensional space of suitable block-Hankel matrices, where it becomes a low-rank matrix completion problem, even if \$\textbackslash mathbf\{A\}\$ is of full rank. For both a uniform and an adaptive random space-time sampling model, we quantify the recoverability of the transition operator via suitable measures of incoherence of these block-Hankel embedding matrices. For graph transition operators these measures of incoherence depend on the interplay between the dynamics and the graph topology. We develop a suitable non-convex iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm, establish its quadratic local convergence, and show that, in optimal scenarios, no more than \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(rn \textbackslash log(nT))\$ space-time samples are sufficient to ensure accurate recovery of a rank-\$r\$ operator \$\textbackslash mathbf\{A\}\$ of size \$n \textbackslash times n\$. This establishes that spatial samples can be substituted by a comparable number of space-time samples. We provide an efficient implementation of the proposed IRLS algorithm with space complexity of order \$O(r n T)\$ and per-iteration time complexity linear in \$n\$. Numerical experiments for transition operators based on several graph models confirm that the theoretical findings accurately track empirical phase transitions, and illustrate the applicability and scalability of the proposed algorithm.},

We provide a theoretical analysis to bound the approximation error. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed pairwise perturbation algorithms are easy to control and converge to minima that are as good as ALS. The experimental results show improvements of up to 3.1× with respect to state-of-the-art ALS approaches for various model tensor problems and real datasets.},

  abstract = {The goal of digital quantum simulation is to approximate the dynamics of a given target Hamiltonian via a sequence of quantum gates, a procedure known as Trotterization. The quality of this approximation can be controlled by the so called Trotter step, that governs the number of required quantum gates per unit simulation time. The stroboscopic dynamics generated by Trotterization is effectively described by a time-independent Hamiltonian, referred to as the Floquet Hamiltonian. In this work, we propose Floquet Hamiltonian learning to reconstruct the experimentally realized Floquet Hamiltonian order-by-order in the Trotter step. This procedure is efficient, i.e., it requires a number of measurements that scales polynomially in the system size, and can be readily implemented in state-of-the-art experiments. With numerical examples, we propose several applications of our method in the context of verification of quantum devices: from the characterization of the distinct sources of errors in digital quantum simulators to determining the optimal operating regime of the device. We show that our protocol provides the basis for feedback-loop design and calibration of new types of quantum gates. Furthermore it can be extended to the case of non-unitary dynamics and used to learn Floquet Liouvillians, thereby offering a way of characterizing the dissipative processes present in NISQ quantum devices.},

Our goal is to decompose the given matrix into its sparse and low-rank components. Such a problem arises in a number of applications in model and system identification and is intractable to solve in general. In this paper we consider a convex optimization formulation to splitting the specified matrix into its components by minimizing a linear combination of the ℓ1 norm and the nuclear norm of the components. We develop a notion of rank-sparsity incoherence, expressed as an uncertainty principle between the sparsity pattern of a matrix and its row and column spaces, and we use it to characterize both fundamental identifiability as well as (deterministic) sufficient conditions for exact recovery. Our analysis is geometric in nature with the tangent spaces to the algebraic varieties of sparse and low-rank matrices playing a prominent role. When the sparse and low-rank matrices are drawn from certain natural random ensembles, we show that the sufficient conditions for exact recovery are satisfied with high probability. We conclude with simulation results on synthetic matrix decomposition problems.},

  abstract = {From the key composite quantum system made of a two-level system (qubit) and a harmonic oscillator (photon) with resonant or dispersive interactions, one derives the corresponding quantum Stochastic Master Equations (SME) when either the qubits or the photons are measured. Starting with an elementary discrete-time formulation based on explicit formulae for the interaction propagators, one shows how to include measurement imperfections and decoherence. This qubit/photon quantum system illustrates the Kraus-map structure of general discrete-time SME governing the dynamics of an open quantum system subject to measurement back-action and decoherence induced by the environment. Then, on the qubit/photon system, one explains the passage to a continuous-time mathematical model where the measurement signal is either a continuous real-value signal (typically homodyne or heterodyne signal) or a discontinuous and integer-value signal obtained from a counter. During this derivation, the Kraus map formulation is preserved in an infinitesimal way. Such a derivation provides also an equivalent Kraus-map formulation to the continuous-time SME usually expressed as stochastic differential equations driven either by Wiener or Poisson processes. From such Kraus-map formulation, simple linear numerical integration schemes are derived that preserve the positivity and the trace of the density operator, i.e. of the quantum state.},

  abstract = {WavePacket is an open-source program package for the numerical simulation of quantum-mechanical dynamics. It can be used to solve time-independent or time-dependent linear Schrödinger and Liouville–von Neumann-equations in one or more dimensions. Also coupled equations can be treated, which allows to simulate molecular quantum dynamics beyond the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. Optionally accounting for the interaction with external electric fields within the semiclassical dipole approximation, WavePacket can be used to simulate experiments involving tailored light pulses in photo-induced physics or chemistry. The graphical capabilities allow visualization of quantum dynamics ‘on the fly’, including Wigner phase space representations. Being easy to use and highly versatile, WavePacket is well suited for the teaching of quantum mechanics as well as for research projects in atomic, molecular and optical physics or in physical or theoretical chemistry. The present Part I deals with the description of closed quantum systems in terms of Schrödinger equations. The emphasis is on discrete variable representations for spatial discretization as well as various techniques for temporal discretization. The upcoming Part II will focus on open quantum systems and dimension reduction; it also describes the codes for optimal control of quantum dynamics. The present work introduces the MATLAB version of WavePacket 5.2.1 which is hosted at the Sourceforge platform, where extensive Wiki-documentation as well as worked-out demonstration examples can be found. Program summary Program Title: WavePacket Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/tc5mrhx9sb.1 Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: Matlab Nature of problem: Schrödingerś equations are of fundamental importance in non-relativistic quantum mechanics of distinguishable particles. The solutions of the time-independent equation (TISE) are wavefunctions in coordinate space, the absolute squares of which are usually interpreted as probability density. The time-dependent equation (TDSE) describes the dynamics of a quantum system evolving in time. It plays a crucial role for the simulation, understanding, and prediction of modern experiments in atomic, molecular and optical physics where systems are driven by temporally shaped external fields. Solution method: All numerical methods compiled in WavePacket are based on discrete variable representations. Currently implemented are Gauss–Hermite, Gauss–Legendre and FFT-based schemes. The TISE is solved either by direct diagonalization or by propagation in imaginary time. For the TDSE there is a choice between second order differencing, operator splitting and Chebychev polynomial methods. Additional comments including Restrictions and Unusual features: The WavePacket program package is rather easy and intuitive to use, providing visualization of quantum dynamics ‘on the fly’. It is mainly intended for low-dimensional systems, typically not exceeding three to five degrees of freedom. Detailed user guides and reference manuals are available through numerous Wiki pages hosted at the SourceForge platform where also a large number of well documented demonstration examples can be found.},

  abstract = {This work presents a nonintrusive physics-preserving method to learn reduced-order models (ROMs) of canonical Hamiltonian systems. Traditional intrusive projection-based model reduction approaches utilize symplectic Galerkin projection to construct Hamiltonian ROMs by projecting Hamilton’s equations of the full model onto a symplectic subspace. This symplectic projection requires complete knowledge about the full model operators and full access to manipulate the computer code. In contrast, the proposed Hamiltonian operator inference approach embeds the physics into the operator inference framework to develop a data-driven model reduction method that preserves the underlying symplectic structure. Our method exploits knowledge of the Hamiltonian functional to define and parametrize a Hamiltonian ROM form which can then be learned from data projected via symplectic projectors. The proposed method is gray-box in that it utilizes knowledge of the Hamiltonian structure at the partial differential equation level, as well as knowledge of spatially local components in the system. However, it does not require access to computer code, only data to learn the models. Our numerical results demonstrate Hamiltonian operator inference on a linear wave equation, the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation, and a nonpolynomial sine–Gordon equation. Accurate long-time predictions far outside the training time interval for nonlinear examples illustrate the generalizability of our learned models.},

  abstract = {Recently, there has been significant progress in understanding the convergence and generalization properties of gradient-based methods for training overparameterized learning models. However, many aspects including the role of small random initialization and how the various parameters of the model are coupled during gradient-based updates to facilitate good generalization remain largely mysterious. A series of recent papers have begun to study this role for non-convex formulations of symmetric Positive Semi-Definite (PSD) matrix sensing problems which involve reconstructing a low-rank PSD matrix from a few linear measurements. The underlying symmetry/PSDness is crucial to existing convergence and generalization guarantees for this problem. In this paper, we study a general overparameterized low-rank matrix sensing problem where one wishes to reconstruct an asymmetric rectangular low-rank matrix from a few linear measurements. We prove that an overparameterized model trained via factorized gradient descent converges to the low-rank matrix generating the measurements. We show that in this setting, factorized gradient descent enjoys two implicit properties: (1) coupling of the trajectory of gradient descent where the factors are coupled in various ways throughout the gradient update trajectory and (2) an algorithmic regularization property where the iterates show a propensity towards low-rank models despite the overparameterized nature of the factorized model. These two implicit properties in turn allow us to show that the gradient descent trajectory from small random initialization moves towards solutions that are both globally optimal and generalize well.},

We propose an efficient protocol based on the estimation of the time-derivatives of few qubit observables using polynomial interpolation for characterizing the underlying Hamiltonian dynamics and Markovian noise of a multi-qubit device. For finite range dynamics, our protocol exponentially relaxes the necessary time-resolution of the measurements and quadratically reduces the overall sample complexity compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, we show that our protocol can characterize the dynamics of systems with algebraically decaying interactions. The implementation of the protocol requires only the preparation of product states and single-qubit measurements. Furthermore, we improve a shadow tomography method for quantum channels that is of independent interest and discuss the robustness of the protocol to various errors. This protocol can be used to parallelize the learning of the Hamiltonian, rendering it applicable for the characterization of both current and future quantum devices.},

  abstract = {tion problem, in which we wish to recover a (low-rank) data matrix from incomplete samples of its entries. A recent convex relaxation of the rank minimization problem minimizes the nuclear norm instead of the rank of the matrix. Another possible model for the rank minimization problem is the nuclear norm regularized linear least squares problem. This regularized problem is a special case of an unconstrained nonsmooth convex optimization problem, in which the objective function is the sum of a convex smooth function with Lipschitz continuous gradient and a convex function on a set of matrices. In this paper, we propose an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm, which terminates in O(1= p ) iterations with an -optimal solution, to solve this un- constrained nonsmooth convex optimization problem, and in particular, the nuclear norm regularized linear least squares problem. We report numerical results for solving large-scale randomly generated matrix completion problems. The numerical results suggest that our algorithm is ecient and robust in solving large-scale random matrix completion problems. In particular, we are able to solve random matrix completion problems with matrix dimensions up to 105 each in less than 3.5 hours on a modest PC.},

  abstract = {The estimation of high dimensional precision matrices has been a central topic in statistical learning. However, as the number of parameters scales quadratically with the dimension p, many state-of-the-art methods do not scale well to solve problems with a very large p. In this paper, we propose a very efficient algorithm for precision matrix estimation via penalized quadratic loss functions. Under the high dimension low sample size setting, the computation complexity of our algorithm is linear in both the sample size and the number of parameters. Such a computation complexity is in some sense optimal, as it is the same as the complexity needed for computing the sample covariance matrix. Numerical studies show that our algorithm is much more efficient than other state-of-the-art methods when the dimension p is very large.},

Although such models can be derived in some special cases, in most practical situations, the exact models are unknown and have to be calibrated. This paper presents a learning method to infer parameters in Markovian open quantum systems from measurement data. One important ingredient in the method is a direct simulation technique of the quantum master equation, which is designed to preserve the completely-positive property with guaranteed accuracy. The method is particularly helpful in the situation where the time intervals between measurements are large. The approach is validated with error estimates and numerical experiments.},

  abstract = {The estimation of signal covariance matrices is a crucial part of many signal processing algorithms. In some applications, the structure of the problem suggests that the underlying, true covariance matrix is the Kronecker product of two valid covariance matrices. Examples of such problems are channel modeling for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications and signal modeling of EEG data. In applications, it may also be that the Kronecker factors in turn can be assumed to possess additional, linear structure. The maximum-likelihood (ML) method for the associated estimation problem has been proposed previously. It is asymptotically efficient but has the drawback of requiring an iterative search for the maximum of the likelihood function. Two methods that are fast and noniterative are proposed in this paper. Both methods are shown to be asymptotically efficient. The first method is a noniterative variant of a well-known alternating maximization technique for the likelihood function. It performs on par with ML in simulations but has the drawback of not allowing for extra structure in addition to the Kronecker structure. The second method is based on covariance matching principles and does not suffer from this drawback. However, while the large sample performance is the same, it performs somewhat worse than the first estimator in small samples. In addition, the Cramér–Rao lower bound for the problem is derived in a compact form. The problem of estimating the Kronecker factors and the problem of detecting if the Kronecker structure is a good model for the covariance matrix of a set of samples are related. Therefore, the problem of detecting the dimensions of the Kronecker factors based on the minimum values of the criterion functions corresponding to the two proposed estimation methods is also treated in this work.},

Using overparametrized factor representations, \$\textbackslash textsf\{ScaledGD(\$\textbackslash lambda\$)\}\$ starts from a small random initialization, and proceeds by gradient descent with a specific form of damped preconditioning to combat bad curvatures induced by overparameterization and ill-conditioning. At the expense of light computational overhead incurred by preconditioners, \$\textbackslash textsf\{ScaledGD(\$\textbackslash lambda\$)\}\$ is remarkably robust to ill-conditioning compared to vanilla gradient descent (\$\textbackslash textsf\{GD\}\$) even with overprameterization. Specifically, we show that, under the Gaussian design, \$\textbackslash textsf\{ScaledGD(\$\textbackslash lambda\$)\}\$ converges to the true low-rank matrix at a constant linear rate after a small number of iterations that scales only logarithmically with respect to the condition number and the problem dimension. This significantly improves over the convergence rate of vanilla \$\textbackslash textsf\{GD\}\$ which suffers from a polynomial dependency on the condition number. Our work provides evidence on the power of preconditioning in accelerating the convergence without hurting generalization in overparameterized learning.},

  abstract = {Alternating least-squares (ALS) is a simple yet effective solver for canonical correlation analysis (CCA). In terms of ease of use, ALS is arguably practitioners' first choice. Despite recent provably guaranteed variants, the empirical performance often remains unsatisfactory. To promote the practical use of ALS for CCA,  we propose truly alternating least-squares. Instead of approximately solving two independent linear systems, in each iteration, it simply solves two coupled linear systems of half the size. It turns out that this coupling procedure is able to bring significant performance improvements in practice. Inspired by accelerated power method, we further propose faster alternating least-squares, where momentum terms are introduced into the update equations. Both algorithms enjoy linear convergence. To make faster ALS even more practical, we put forward adaptive alternating least-squares to avoid tuning the momentum parameter, which is as easy to use as the plain ALS while retaining advantages of the fast version. Experiments on several datasets empirically demonstrate  the superiority of the proposed algorithms to recent variants.},
