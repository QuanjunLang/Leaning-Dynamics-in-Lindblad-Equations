  abstract = {This work is concerned with determination of the steady-state structure of time-independent Lindblad master equations, especially those possessing more than one steady state. The approach here is to treat Lindblad systems as generalizations of unitary quantum mechanics, extending the intuition of symmetries and conserved quantities to the dissipative case. We combine and apply various results to obtain an exhaustive characterization of the infinite-time behavior of Lindblad evolution, including both the structure of the infinite-time density matrix and its dependence on initial conditions. The effect of the environment in the infinite-time limit can therefore be tracked exactly for arbitrary state initialization and without knowledge of dynamics at intermediate time. As a consequence, sufficient criteria for determining the steady state of a Lindblad master equation are obtained. These criteria are knowledge of the initial state, a basis for the steady-state subspace, and all conserved quantities. We give examples of two-qubit dissipation and single-mode d-photon absorption where all quantities are determined analytically. Applications of these techniques to quantum information, computation, and feedback control are discussed.},

  abstract = {To identify power system eigenvalues from measurement data, Prony analysis, matrix pencil (MP), and eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) are three major methods. This paper reviews the three methods and sheds insight on the principles of the three methods: eigenvalue identification through various Hankel matrix formulations. In addition, multiple channel data handling and noise-resilience techniques are investigated. In the literature, singular value decomposition (SVD)-based rank reduction technique has been applied to MP and resulted in a reduced-order system eigenvalue estimation and an excellent noise resilient feature. In this paper, ERA is refined using the SVD-based rank reduction to achieve superior performance. Further, a reduced-order Prony analysis method is proposed. With this technique, Prony analysis can not only give reduced-order system eigenvalues, but also become noise resilient. Four case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the eigenvalue identification methods, including a tutorial example of an RLC circuit resonance, a power grid oscillation case study for a 16-machine 68-bus system, an example of subsynchronous resonance (SSR) of a type-3 wind grid integration system, and real-world oscillation events captured by Independent System Operator-New England (ISO-NE).},

  abstract = {For any master equation which is local in time, whether Markovian, non-Markovian, of Lindblad form or not, a general procedure is reviewed for constructing the corresponding linear map from the initial state to the state at time t, including its Kraus-type representations. Formally, this is equivalent to solving the master equation. For an N-dimensional Hilbert space it requires (i) solving a first order N\textasciicircum 2 x N\textasciicircum 2 matrix time evolution (to obtain the completely positive map), and (ii) diagonalising a related N\textasciicircum 2 x N\textasciicircum 2 matrix (to obtain a Kraus-type representation). Conversely, for a given time-dependent linear map, a necessary and sufficient condition is given for the existence of a corresponding master equation, where the (not necessarily unique) form of this equation is explicitly determined. It is shown that a `best possible' master equation may always be defined, for approximating the evolution in the case that no exact master equation exists. Examples involving qubits are given.},

In particular we use these fixed-point algorithms for making approximations by sums of exponentials, i.e., frequency estimation. For the basic formulation of the fixed-point algorithm we show that it converges to the solution of a related minimization problem, namely the one obtained by replacing the original objective function with its convex envelope and keeping the structured matrix constraint unchanged. It often happens that this solution agrees with the solution to the original minimization problem, and we provide a simple criterion for when this is true. We also provide more general fixed-point algorithms that can be used to treat the problems of making weighted approximations by sums of exponentials given equally or unequally spaced sampling. We apply the method to the case of missing data, although the above mentioned convergence results do not hold in this case. However, it turns out that the method often gives perfect reconstruction (up to machine precision) in such cases. We also discuss multidimensional extensions, and illustrate how the proposed algorithms can be used to recover sums of exponentials in several variables, but when samples are available only along a curve.},

Realistic quantum systems are often affected by dissipation and decoherence due to coupling to an external environment. This raises the question whether the steady states of such open quantum systems contain sufficient information allowing for full and efficient reconstruction of the system’s dynamics. We find that such a reconstruction is possible for generic local Markovian dynamics. We propose a recovery method that uses only local measurements; for systems with finite-range interactions, the method recovers the Lindbladian acting on each spatial domain using only observables within that domain. We numerically study the accuracy of the reconstruction as a function of the number of measurements, type of open-system dynamics and system size. Interestingly, we show that couplings to external environments can in fact facilitate the reconstruction of Hamiltonians composed of commuting terms.},

Both the celebrated Kalman filter and the linear quadratic regulator require knowledge of the system dynamics to provide analytic guarantees. Naturally, learning the dynamics of a linear dynamical system from linear measurements has been intensively studied since Rudolph Kalman's pioneering work in the 1960's. Towards these ends, we provide the first polynomial time algorithm for learning a linear dynamical system from a polynomial length trajectory up to polynomial error in the system parameters under essentially minimal assumptions: observability, controllability, and marginal stability. Our algorithm is built on a method of moments estimator to directly estimate Markov parameters from which the dynamics can be extracted. Furthermore, we provide statistical lower bounds when our observability and controllability assumptions are violated.},

This problem is already well-studied under the assumption that the interaction terms, \$E\_a\$, are given, and only the interaction strengths, \$\textbackslash lambda\_a\$, are unknown. But is it possible to learn a local Hamiltonian without prior knowledge of its interaction structure? We present a new, general approach to Hamiltonian learning that not only solves the challenging structure learning variant, but also resolves other open questions in the area, all while achieving the gold standard of Heisenberg-limited scaling. In particular, our algorithm recovers the Hamiltonian to \$\textbackslash varepsilon\$ error with an evolution time scaling with \$1/\textbackslash varepsilon\$, and has the following appealing properties: (1) it does not need to know the Hamiltonian terms; (2) it works beyond the short-range setting, extending to any Hamiltonian \$H\$ where the sum of terms interacting with a qubit has bounded norm; (3) it evolves according to \$H\$ in constant time \$t\$ increments, thus achieving constant time resolution. To our knowledge, no prior algorithm with Heisenberg-limited scaling existed with even one of these properties. As an application, we can also learn Hamiltonians exhibiting power-law decay up to accuracy \$\textbackslash varepsilon\$ with total evolution time beating the standard limit of \$1/\textbackslash varepsilon\textasciicircum 2\$.},

To achieve this lower bound, one must probe the map with a particular set of \$d\$ pure states. We further compare the performance of different compressed sensing algorithms used to reconstruct a near-unitary process from such data. We find that when we have accurate prior information, an appropriate compressed sensing method reduces the required data needed for high-fidelity estimation, and different estimators applied to the same data are sensitive to different types of noise. Compressed sensing techniques can therefore be used both as indicators of error models and to validate the use of the prior assumptions.},

  abstract = {The problem of accurately reconstructing a piece-wise smooth, 2(pi)-periodic function f and its first few derivatives, given only a truncated Fourier series representation of f, is studied and solved. The reconstruction process is divided into two steps. In the first step, the first 2N + 1 Fourier coefficients of f are used to approximate the locations and magnitudes of the discontinuities in f and its first M derivatives. This is accomplished by first finding initial estimates of these quantities based on certain properties of Gibbs phenomenon, and then refining these estimates by fitting the asymptotic form of the Fourier coefficients to the given coefficients using a least-squares approach. It is conjectured that the locations of the singularities are approximated to within O(N(sup -M-2), and the associated jump of the k(sup th) derivative of f is approximated to within O(N(sup -M-l+k), as N approaches infinity, and the method is robust. These estimates are then used with a class of singular basis functions, which have certain 'built-in' singularities, to construct a new sequence of approximations to f. Each of these new approximations is the sum of a piecewise smooth function and a new Fourier series partial sum. When N is proportional to M, it is shown that these new approximations, and their derivatives, converge exponentially in the maximum norm to f, and its corresponding derivatives, except in the union of a finite number of small open intervals containing the points of singularity of f. The total measure of these intervals decreases exponentially to zero as M approaches infinity. The technique is illustrated with several examples.},

Introducing this strong inductive bias into a GP improves modelling of such data. Using smith normal form algorithms, a symbolic technique, we overcome two current restrictions in the state of the art: (1) the need for certain uniqueness conditions in the set of solutions, typically assumed in classical ODE solvers and their probabilistic counterparts, and (2) the restriction to controllable systems, typically assumed when encoding differential equations in covariance functions.

By using the Poisson summation to discretize integral representations of e.g., power functions r−β, β{$>$}0, we obtain approximations with uniform relative error on the whole real line. Our approach is applicable to a class of functions and, in particular, yields a separated representation for the function e−xy. As a result, we obtain sharper error estimates and a simpler method to derive trapezoidal-type quadratures valid on finite intervals. We also introduce a new reduction algorithm for the case where our representation has an excessive number of terms with small exponents. As an application of these new estimates, we simplify and improve previous results on separated representations of operators with radial kernels. For any finite but arbitrary accuracy, we obtain new separated representations of solutions of Laplace's equation satisfying boundary conditions on the half-space or the sphere. These representations inherit a multiresolution structure from the Gaussian approximation leading to fast algorithms for the evaluation of the solutions. In the case of the sphere, our approach provides a foundation for a new multiresolution approach to evaluating and estimating models of gravitational potentials used for satellite orbit computations.},

  abstract = {Modeling physiochemical relationships using dynamic data is a common task in fields throughout science and engineering. A common step in developing generalizable, mechanistic models is to fit unmeasured parameters to measured data. However, fitting differential equation-based models can be computation-intensive and uncertain due to the presence of nonlinearity, noise, and sparsity in the data, which in turn causes convergence to local minima and divergence issues. This work proposes a merger of machine learning (ML) and mechanistic approaches by employing ML models as a means to fit nonlinear mechanistic ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Using a two-stage indirect approach, neural ODEs are used to estimate state derivatives, which are then used to estimate the parameters of a more interpretable mechanistic ODE model. In addition to its computational efficiency, the proposed method demonstrates the ability of neural ODEs to better estimate derivative information than interpolating methods based on algebraic data-driven models. Most notably, the proposed method is shown to yield accurate predictions even when little information is known about the parameters of the ODEs. The proposed parameter estimation approach is believed to be most advantageous when the ODE to be fit is strongly nonlinear with respect to its unknown parameters.},

The key enabler for these features is the introduction of uniform sub-Nyquist sampling through decimation of the dense signal data. We actually make use of possible aliasing effects to recondition the problem statement rather than that we avoid aliasing. In Section 2 the standard exponential analysis is described, including a sensitivity analysis. In Section 3 the ingredients for the new approach are collected, of which good use is made in Section 4 where we essentially bring everything together in what we call VEXPA. Some numerical examples of the new procedure illustrate in Section 5 that the additional features are indeed realized and that VEXPA is a valuable add-on to any stand-alone exponential analysis. While returning a lot of additional output, it maintains a favourable comparison to the CRLB of the underlying method, for which we here choose a matrix pencil method. Moreover, the output reliability of VEXPA is similar to that of atomic norm minimization, whereas its computational complexity is far less.},

Our method is able to alleviate the computational difficulties encountered by the classical parametric methods. These difficulties are due to the implicit definition of the model. We propose the use of a nonparametric estimator of regression functions as a first-step in the construction of an M-estimator, and we show the consistency of the derived estimator under general conditions. In the case of spline estimators, we prove asymptotic normality, and that the rate of convergence is the usual √n-rate for parametric estimators.

  abstract = {Ordinary Differential Equations are widespread tools to model chemical, physical, biological process but they usually rely on parameters which are of critical importance in terms of dynamic and need to be estimated directly from the data. Classical statistical approaches (nonlinear least squares, maximum likelihood estimator) can give unsatisfactory results because of computational difficulties and ill-posed statistical problem. New estimation methods that use some nonparametric devices have been proposed to circumvent these issues. We present a new estimator that shares properties with Two-Step estimators and Generalized Smoothing (introduced by Ramsay et al. [37]). Our estimation method relies on a relaxation and penalization scheme to regularize the inverse problem. We introduce a perturbed model and we use optimal control theory for constructing a criterion that aims at minimizing the discrepancy between data and the original model. Here, we focus on the case of linear Ordinary Differential Equations as our criterion has a closed-form expression that permits a detailed analysis. Our approach avoids the use of a nonparametric estimator of the derivative, which is one of the main causes of inaccuracy in Two-Step estimators. Regarding the theoretical asymptotic behavior of √our estimator, we show its consistency and that we reach the parametric n-rate when regression splines are used in the first step. We consider the estimation of two models possessing sloppy parameters, which usually makes the estimation of ODE models an ill-posed problem in applications [20, 41] and shows the efficiency of the Tracking estimator. Quite interestingly, our relaxation scheme makes the estimator robust to some kind of model misspecification, as shown in simulations.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a novel algorithm to approximate the matrix with minimum nuclear norm among all matrices obeying a set of convex constraints. This problem may be understood as the convex relaxation of a rank minimization problem, and arises in many important applications as in the task of recovering a large matrix from a small subset of its entries (the famous Netflix problem). Off-the-shelf algorithms such as interior point methods are not directly amenable to large problems of this kind with over a million unknown entries. This paper develops a simple first-order and easy-to-implement algorithm that is extremely efficient at addressing problems in which the optimal solution has low rank. The algorithm is iterative and produces a sequence of matrices (X\textasciicircum k, Y\textasciicircum k) and at each step, mainly performs a soft-thresholding operation on the singular values of the matrix Y\textasciicircum k. There are two remarkable features making this attractive for low-rank matrix completion problems. The first is that the soft-thresholding operation is applied to a sparse matrix; the second is that the rank of the iterates X\textasciicircum k is empirically nondecreasing. Both these facts allow the algorithm to make use of very minimal storage space and keep the computational cost of each iteration low. We provide numerical examples in which 1,000 by 1,000 matrices are recovered in less than a minute on a modest desktop computer. We also demonstrate that our approach is amenable to very large scale problems by recovering matrices of rank about 10 with nearly a billion unknowns from just about 0.4\% of their sampled entries. Our methods are connected with linearized Bregman iterations for l1 minimization, and we develop a framework in which one can understand these algorithms in terms of well-known Lagrange multiplier algorithms.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a mathematical theory of super-resolution. Broadly speaking, super-resolution is the problem of recovering the fine details of an object—the high end of its spectrum—from coarse scale information only—from samples at the low end of the spectrum. Suppose we have many point sources at unknown locations in Œ0; 1 and with unknown complex-valued amplitudes. We only observe Fourier samples of this object up to a frequency cutoff fc. We show that one can super-resolve these point sources with infinite precision—i.e., recover the exact locations and amplitudes—by solving a simple convex optimization problem, which can essentially be reformulated as a semidefinite program. This holds provided that the distance between sources is at least 2=fc. This result extends to higher dimensions and other models. In one dimension, for instance, it is possible to recover a piecewise smooth function by resolving the discontinuity points with infinite precision as well. We also show that the theory and methods are robust to noise. In particular, in the discrete setting we develop some theoretical results explaining how the accuracy of the super-resolved signal is expected to degrade when both the noise level and the super-resolution factor vary. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

This discovery can save the cost of computation, and accelerate the converging process when taking the average over noisy trajectories. As a result, our method can be widely applied to many open quantum models, especially large-scale systems and extend the quantum regression theory to the non-Markovian case. In the short-time simulations, it is observed a significant difference between Markovian and non-Markovian cases, which can be applied to realize the environmental spectrum detection and enhance the measurement sensitivity in varying open quantum systems.},

Moreover, we prove that, if the steady state of the system is unique, one single block contains all the information about it, and that this imposes a constraint on the possible steady-state coherences of the unique state, ruling out some of them. To provide some examples, we show how the symmetry appears for two coupled spins interacting with separate baths, as well as for two harmonic oscillators immersed in a common environment. In both cases the standard derivation and solution of the master equation is simplified, as well as the search for the steady state. The block diagonalization does not appear when a local master equation is chosen.},

  abstract = {Here we revisit one of the prototypical tasks for characterizing the structure of noise in quantum devices: estimating every eigenvalue of an \$n\$-qubit Pauli noise channel to error \$\textbackslash epsilon\$. Prior work (Chen et al., 2022) proved no-go theorems for this task in the practical regime where one has a limited amount of quantum memory, e.g. any protocol with \$\textbackslash le 0.99n\$ ancilla qubits of quantum memory must make exponentially many measurements, provided it is non-concatenating. Such protocols can only interact with the channel by repeatedly preparing a state, passing it through the channel, and measuring immediately afterward. This left open a natural question: does the lower bound hold even for general protocols, i.e. ones which chain together many queries to the channel, interleaved with arbitrary data-processing channels, before measuring? Surprisingly, in this work we show the opposite: there is a protocol that can estimate the eigenvalues of a Pauli channel to error \$\textbackslash epsilon\$ using only \$O(\textbackslash log n/\textbackslash epsilon\textasciicircum 2)\$ ancilla qubits and \$\textbackslash tilde\{O\}(n\textasciicircum 2/\textbackslash epsilon\textasciicircum 2)\$ measurements. In contrast, we show that any protocol with zero ancilla, even a concatenating one, must make \$\textbackslash Omega(2\textasciicircum n/\textbackslash epsilon\textasciicircum 2)\$ measurements, which is tight. Our results imply, to our knowledge, the first quantum learning task where logarithmically many qubits of quantum memory suffice for an exponential statistical advantage.},

  abstract = {Tensor CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition is a powerful but computationally challenging tool in modern data analytics. In this paper, we show ways of sampling intermediate steps of alternating minimization algorithms for computing low rank tensor CP decompositions, leading to the sparse alternating least squares (SPALS) method. Specifically, we sample the the Khatri-Rao product, which arises as an intermediate object during the iterations of alternating least squares. This product captures the interactions between different tensor modes, and form the main computational bottleneck for solving many tensor related tasks. By exploiting the spectral structures of the matrix Khatri-Rao product, we provide efficient access to its statistical leverage scores. When applied to the tensor CP decomposition, our method leads to the first algorithm that runs in sublinear time per-iteration and approximates the output of deterministic alternating least squares algorithms. Empirical evaluations of this approach show significantly speedups over existing randomized and deterministic routines for performing CP decomposition. On a tensor of the size 2.4m by 6.6m by 92k with over 2 billion nonzeros formed by Amazon product reviews, our routine converges in two minutes to the same error as deterministic ALS.},

Apart from its existence, examining how to trace dissipation from observational data is important and may stimulate ways to suppress the dissipation. In this paper, we propose to learn about quantum dissipation from dynamical observations using the neural ordinary differential equation, and then demonstrate this method concretely on two open quantum-spin systems: A large spin system and a spin-1/2 chain. We also investigate the learning efficiency of the dataset, which provides useful guidance for data acquisition in experiments. Our work helps to facilitate effective modeling and decoherence suppression in open quantum systems.},

  abstract = {There has been significant interest in understanding how practical constraints on contemporary quantum devices impact the complexity of quantum learning. For the classic question of tomography, recent work tightly characterized the copy complexity for any protocol that can only measure one copy of the unknown state at a time, showing it is polynomially worse than if one can make fully-entangled measurements. While we now have a fairly complete picture of the rates for such tasks in the near-term and fault-tolerant regimes, it remains poorly understood what the landscape in between looks like. In this work, we study tomography in the natural setting where one can make measurements of \$t\$ copies at a time. For sufficiently small \$\textbackslash epsilon\$, we show that for any \$t \textbackslash le d\textasciicircum 2\$, \$\textbackslash widetilde\{\textbackslash Theta\}(\textbackslash frac\{d\textasciicircum 3\}\{\textbackslash sqrt\{t\}\textbackslash epsilon\textasciicircum 2\})\$ copies are necessary and sufficient to learn an unknown \$d\$-dimensional state \$\textbackslash rho\$ to trace distance \$\textbackslash epsilon\$. This gives a smooth and optimal interpolation between the known rates for single-copy and fully-entangled measurements. To our knowledge, this is the first smooth entanglement-copy tradeoff known for any quantum learning task, and for tomography, no intermediate point on this curve was known, even at \$t = 2\$. An important obstacle is that unlike the optimal single-copy protocol, the optimal fully-entangled protocol is inherently biased and thus precludes naive batching approaches. Instead, we devise a novel two-stage procedure that uses Keyl's algorithm to refine a crude estimate for \$\textbackslash rho\$ based on single-copy measurements. A key insight is to use Schur-Weyl sampling not to estimate the spectrum of \$\textbackslash rho\$, but to estimate the deviation of \$\textbackslash rho\$ from the maximally mixed state. When \$\textbackslash rho\$ is far from the maximally mixed state, we devise a novel quantum splitting procedure that reduces to the case where \$\textbackslash rho\$ is close to maximally mixed.},

  abstract = {Substantial progress has been made recently on developing provably accurate and efficient algorithms for low-rank matrix factorization via nonconvex optimization. While conventional wisdom often takes a dim view of nonconvex optimization algorithms due to their susceptibility to spurious local minima, simple iterative methods such as gradient descent have been remarkably successful in practice. The theoretical footings, however, had been largely lacking until recently. In this tutorial-style overview, we highlight the important role of statistical models in enabling efficient nonconvex optimization with performance guarantees. We review two contrasting approaches: (1) two-stage algorithms, which consist of a tailored initialization step followed by successive refinement; and (2) global landscape analysis and initialization-free algorithms. Several canonical matrix factorization problems are discussed, including but not limited to matrix sensing, phase retrieval, matrix completion, blind deconvolution, robust principal component analysis, phase synchronization, and joint alignment. Special care is taken to illustrate the key technical insights underlying their analyses. This article serves as a testament that the integrated consideration of optimization and statistics leads to fruitful research findings.},

In the area of quantum physics, making progress towards these goals is significantly more challenging due to the curse of dimensionality as well as the counter-intuitive nature of quantum mechanics. Here, we present the QNODE, a latent neural ODE trained on expectation values of closed and open quantum systems dynamics. It can learn to generate such measurement data and extrapolate outside of its training region that satisfies the von Neumann and time-local Lindblad master equations for closed and open quantum systems respectively in an unsupervised means. Furthermore, the QNODE rediscovers quantum mechanical laws such as the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in a data-driven way, without any constraint or guidance. Additionally, we show that trajectories that are generated from the QNODE that are close in its latent space have similar quantum dynamics while preserving the physics of the training system.},

It is also well-known that recovering spectral information from a signal using a parametric method can be ill-posed or ill-conditioned and therefore should be done with caution. We present an exponential analysis method to retrieve high-resolution information from coarse-scale measurements, using uniform downsampling. We exploit rather than avoid aliasing. While we loose the unicity of the solution by the downsampling, it allows to recondition the problem statement and increase the resolution. Our technique can be combined with different existing implementations of multi-exponential analysis (matrix pencil, MUSIC, ESPRIT, APM, generalized overdetermined eigenvalue solver, simultaneous QR factorization, …) and so is very versatile. It seems to be especially useful in the presence of clusters of frequencies that are difficult to distinguish from one another.},

This computationally simple technique can serve as an alternative to numerical evaluation of the popular non‐linear least squares estimator, which typically requires the use of a multistep iterative algorithm and repetitive numerical integration of the ordinary differential equation system. The one‐step method starts from a preliminary                              ‐consistent estimator of the parameter of interest and next turns it into an asymptotic (as the sample size               n               →               ∞               ) equivalent of the least squares estimator through a numerically straightforward procedure.

The preliminary                              ‐consistent estimator that we use depends on non‐parametric smoothing, and we provide a data‐driven methodology for choosing its tuning parameter and support it by theory.

When both bases are orthogonal, it is known that the sparse representation is unique when the sparsity K of the signal satisfies K {$<$}; 1/μ(D), where μ(D) is the mutual coherence of the dictionary. Furthermore, the sparse representation can be obtained in polynomial time by basis pursuit (BP), when K {$<$}; 0.91/μ(D). Therefore, there is a gap between the unicity condition and the one required to use the polynomial-complexity BP formulation. For the case of general dictionaries, it is also well known that finding the sparse representation under the only constraint of unicity is NP-hard. In this paper, we introduce, for the case of Fourier and canonical bases, a polynomial complexity algorithm that finds all the possible K-sparse representations of a signal under the weaker condition that K {$<$}; √2/μ(D). Consequently, when K {$<$}; 1/μ(D), the proposed algorithm solves the unique sparse representation problem for this structured dictionary in polynomial time. We further show that the same method can be extended to many other pairs of bases, one of which must have local atoms. Examples include the union of Fourier and local Fourier bases, the union of discrete cosine transform and canonical bases, and the union of random Gaussian and canonical bases.},

In this paper, we propose the use of Kronecker product matrices in CS for two purposes. First, such matrices can act as sparsifying bases that jointly model the structure present in all of the signal dimensions. Second, such matrices can represent the measurement protocols used in distributed settings. Our formulation enables the derivation of analytical bounds for the sparse approximation of multidimensional signals and CS recovery performance, as well as a means of evaluating novel distributed measurement schemes.},

  abstract = {Intuitively, if a density operator has small rank, then it should be easier to estimate from experimental data, since in this case only a few eigenvectors need to be learned. We prove two complementary results that confirm this intuition. First, we show that a low-rank density matrix can be estimated using fewer copies of the state, i.e., the sample complexity of tomography decreases with the rank. Second, we show that unknown low-rank states can be reconstructed from an incomplete set of measurements, using techniques from compressed sensing and matrix completion. These techniques use simple Pauli measurements, and their output can be certified without making any assumptions about the unknown state. We give a new theoretical analysis of compressed tomography, based on the restricted isometry property (RIP) for low-rank matrices. Using these tools, we obtain near-optimal error bounds, for the realistic situation where the data contains noise due to finite statistics, and the density matrix is full-rank with decaying eigenvalues. We also obtain upper-bounds on the sample complexity of compressed tomography, and almost-matching lower bounds on the sample complexity of any procedure using adaptive sequences of Pauli measurements. Using numerical simulations, we compare the performance of two compressed sensing estimators with standard maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE). We find that, given comparable experimental resources, the compressed sensing estimators consistently produce higher-fidelity state reconstructions than MLE. In addition, the use of an incomplete set of measurements leads to faster classical processing with no loss of accuracy. Finally, we show how to certify the accuracy of a low rank estimate using direct fidelity estimation and we describe a method for compressed quantum process tomography that works for processes with small Kraus rank.},

  abstract = {Characterizing the interactions and dynamics of quantum mechanical systems is an essential task in the development of quantum technologies. We propose an efficient protocol based on the estimation of the time derivatives of few qubit observables using polynomial interpolation for characterizing the underlying Hamiltonian dynamics and Markovian noise of a multi-qubit device. For finite range dynamics, our protocol exponentially relaxes the necessary time resolution of the measurements and quadratically reduces the overall sample complexity compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, we show that our protocol can characterize the dynamics of systems with algebraically decaying interactions. The implementation of the protocol requires only the preparation of product states and single-qubit measurements. Furthermore, we develop a shadow tomography method for quantum channels that is of independent interest. This protocol can be used to parallelize to learn the Hamiltonian, rendering it applicable for the characterization of both current and future quantum devices.},

This poses severe challenges in the efficient~control, calibration and validation~of quantum states and their dynamics. Although the full simulation of large-scale quantum systems may only be possible on a quantum computer, classical characterization and optimization methods still play an important role. Here, we review different approaches that use classical post-processing techniques, possibly combined with adaptive optimization, to learn quantum systems, their correlation properties, dynamics and interaction with the environment. We discuss theoretical proposals and successful implementations across different multiple-qubit architectures such as spin qubits, trapped ions, photonic and atomic systems, and superconducting circuits.

To allow a smooth tradeoff between the reduction in the number of parameters (to reduce estimation variance) and the accuracy of the covariance approximation (affecting estimation bias), we introduce a diagonally loaded modification of the sum-of-kronecker products representation in [1]. We derive an asymptotic Crame´r-Rao bound (CRB) on the minimum attainable mean squared predictor coefficient estimation error for unbiased estimators of Kronecker structured covariance matrices. We illustrate the accuracy of the diagonally loaded Kronecker sum decomposition by applying it to the prediction of human activity video.},

Our methods have several features that make them amenable to experimental implementation: they require only simple Pauli measurements, use fast convex optimization, are stable against noise, and can be applied to states that are only approximately low rank. The acquired data can be used to certify that the state is indeed close to pure, so no a priori assumptions are needed.},

Anshu, Arunachalam, Kuwahara, and Soleimanifar [AAKS21] recently studied the sample complexity (number of copies of ρ needed) of this problem for geometrically local N-qubit Hamiltonians. In the high-temperature (low β) regime, their algorithm has sample complexity poly (N, 1/β, 1/ε) and can be implemented with polynomial, but suboptimal, time complexity. In this paper, we study the same question for a more general class of Hamiltonians. We show how to learn the coefficients of a Hamiltonian to error ε with sample complexity S=O(\textbackslash log N/(\textbackslash beta\textbackslash varepsilon)\textsuperscript{2}) and time complexity linear in the sample size, O(SN). Furthermore, we prove a matching lower bound showing that our algorithm’s sample complexity is optimal, and hence our time complexity is also optimal. In the appendix, we show that virtually the same algorithm can be used to learn H from a real-time evolution unitary e\textsuperscript{-i t H} in a small t regime with similar sample and time complexity.},

Using first-order derivatives as a feature, the proposed method is expected to have low computational complexity, and it can theoretically reduce blur, blocking, and ringing artifacts in edge areas compared to previous methods. Experiments were conducted using 900 natural grayscale images from the USC-SIPI Database. We evaluated the proposed and previous methods using peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity, feature similarity, and computation time.

The key requirement on the measurement matrices is typically the restricted isometry property, that is, approximate orthonormality when acting on the subspace to be recovered. Among the most widely used random matrix measurement models are (a) independent subgaussian models and (b) randomized Fourier-based models, allowing for the efficient computation of the measurements. For the now ubiquitous tensor data, direct application of the known recovery algorithms to the vectorized or matricized tensor is memory-heavy because of the huge measurement matrices to be constructed and stored. In this paper, we propose modewise measurement schemes based on subgaussian and randomized Fourier measurements. These modewise operators act on the pairs or other small subsets of the tensor modes separately. They require significantly less memory than the measurements working on the vectorized tensor, provably satisfy the tensor restricted isometry property and experimentally can recover the tensor data from fewer measurements and do not require impractical storage.},

By exploiting the structure of the dictionary, ProSparse is able to reconstruct sparse signals beyond the recovery bound of Basis Pursuit. We generalize this framework for a broader class of dictionaries which are still formed from the union of two bases. The proposed algorithm achieves perfect reconstruction over a lower sparsity level than Basis Pursuit in noiseless cases. In the presence of noise, we extend the ProSparse Denoise algorithm to the generalized dictionaries by considering their intrinsic structure.

  abstract = {Minimizing the rank of a matrix subject to affine constraints is a fundamental problem with many important applications in machine learning and statistics. In this paper we propose a simple and fast algorithm SVP (Singular Value Projection) for rank minimization under affine constraints ARMP and show that SVP recovers the minimum rank solution for affine constraints that satisfy a Restricted Isometry Property\vphantom\{\} (RIP). Our method guarantees geometric convergence rate even in the presence of noise and requires strictly weaker assumptions on the RIP constants than the existing methods. We also introduce a Newton-step for our SVP framework to speed-up the convergence with substantial empirical gains. Next, we address a practically important application of ARMP - the problem of low-rank matrix completion, for which the defining affine constraints do not directly obey RIP, hence the guarantees of SVP do not hold. However, we provide partial progress towards a proof of exact recovery for our algorithm by showing a more restricted isometry property and observe empirically that our algorithm recovers low-rank Incoherent matrices from an almost optimal number of uniformly sampled entries. We also demonstrate empirically that our algorithms outperform existing methods, such as those of \textbackslash cite\{CaiCS2008,LeeB2009b, KeshavanOM2009\}, for ARMP and the matrix completion problem by an order of magnitude and are also more robust to noise and sampling schemes. In particular, results show that our SVP-Newton method is significantly robust to noise and performs impressively on a more realistic power-law sampling scheme for the matrix completion problem.},

We here introduce an even more general model, namely the partial-trace regression model, a family of linear mappings from matrix-valued inputs to matrix-valued outputs; this model subsumes the trace regression model and thus the linear regression model. Borrowing tools from quantum information theory, where partial trace operators have been extensively studied, we propose a framework for learning partial trace regression models from data by taking advantage of the so-called low-rank Kraus representation of completely positive maps. We show the relevance of our framework with synthetic and real-world experiments conducted for both i) matrix-to-matrix regression and ii) positive semidefinite matrix completion, two tasks which can be formulated as partial trace regression problems.},

In particular, we show that PM is optimal with respect to the previously established min-max bound for the problem, in the setting when the measurement bandwidth is constant, with the minimal separation going to zero. Our main technical contribution is an accurate analysis of the inter-relations between the different errors in each step of PM, resulting in previously unnoticed cancellations. We also prove that PM is numerically stable in finite-precision arithmetic. We believe our analysis will pave the way to providing accurate analysis of known algorithms for the super-resolution problem in full generality.},

Density matrix propagation is performed by numerically solving the Liouville–von-Neumann equation. In order to simulate dissipation and decoherence effects, the Lindblad formalism is implemented. Furthermore, QDT supplies practical analysis and plotting functions, such as visualization of density matrix and expectation value dynamics, that facilitate the evaluation of simulation results. QDT further provides a module for the simulation of coherent multidimensional spectroscopy.

The simulation of the time evolution of these systems by numerically solving differential equations is not straightforward, however. Simulation code that is written from scratch is time-consuming to create and prone to errors during implementation. Furthermore, if code bases deviate drastically between research groups, reproducibility of results becomes challenging, and communication is hindered. Solution method: QDT addresses the above issues by providing a modular toolbox that contains, among others, elements for the simulation of multi-level quantum systems, quantum harmonic oscillators, their interaction with external electric fields, and dissipation. These elements can be combined by the user to build a specific system of interest. All operators are created and expanded automatically based on a single script file provided by the user. Simulation tasks are automated by a single function call, and parallelized in case of extensive tasks.},

  abstract = {Quantum process tomography is the task of reconstructing unknown quantum channels from measured data. In this work, we introduce compressed sensing-based methods that facilitate the reconstruction of quantum channels of low Kraus rank. Our main contribution is the analysis of a natural measurement model for this task: We assume that data is obtained by sending pure states into the channel and measuring expectation values on the output. Neither ancillary systems nor coherent operations across multiple channel uses are required. Most previous results on compressed process reconstruction reduce the problem to quantum state tomography on the channel's Choi matrix. While this ansatz yields recovery guarantees from an essentially minimal number of measurements, physical implementations of such schemes would typically involve ancillary systems. A priori, it is unclear whether a measurement model tailored directly to quantum process tomography might require more measurements. We establish that this is not the case. Technically, we prove recovery guarantees for three different reconstruction algorithms. The reconstructions are based on a trace, diamond, and \$\textbackslash ell\_2\$-norm minimization, respectively. Our recovery guarantees are uniform in the sense that with one random choice of measurement settings all quantum channels can be recovered equally well. Moreover, stability against arbitrary measurement noise and robustness against violations of the low-rank assumption is guaranteed. Numerical studies demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.},

This Spatio-Temporal Transition Operator Recovery problem is motivated by the recent interest in learning time-varying graph signals that are driven by graph operators depending on the underlying graph topology. We address the nonlinearity of the problem by embedding it into a higher-dimensional space of suitable block-Hankel matrices, where it becomes a low-rank matrix completion problem, even if \$\textbackslash mathbf\{A\}\$ is of full rank. For both a uniform and an adaptive random space-time sampling model, we quantify the recoverability of the transition operator via suitable measures of incoherence of these block-Hankel embedding matrices. For graph transition operators these measures of incoherence depend on the interplay between the dynamics and the graph topology. We develop a suitable non-convex iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm, establish its quadratic local convergence, and show that, in optimal scenarios, no more than \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(rn \textbackslash log(nT))\$ space-time samples are sufficient to ensure accurate recovery of a rank-\$r\$ operator \$\textbackslash mathbf\{A\}\$ of size \$n \textbackslash times n\$. This establishes that spatial samples can be substituted by a comparable number of space-time samples. We provide an efficient implementation of the proposed IRLS algorithm with space complexity of order \$O(r n T)\$ and per-iteration time complexity linear in \$n\$. Numerical experiments for transition operators based on several graph models confirm that the theoretical findings accurately track empirical phase transitions, and illustrate the applicability and scalability of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {.We study the problem of decomposing a polynomial  into a sum of  squares by minimizing a quadratically penalized objective . This objective is nonconvex and is equivalent to the rank- Burer–Monteiro factorization of a semidefinite program (SDP) encoding the sum of squares decomposition. We show that for all univariate polynomials , if , then  has no spurious second-order critical points, showing that all local optima are also global optima. This is in contrast to previous work showing that for general SDPs, in addition to genericity conditions,  has to be roughly the square root of the number of constraints (the degree of ) for there to be no spurious second-order critical points. Our proof uses tools from computational algebraic geometry and can be interpreted as constructing a certificate using the first- and second-order necessary conditions. We also show that by choosing a norm based on sampling equally spaced points on the circle, the gradient  can be computed in nearly linear time using fast Fourier transforms. Experimentally we demonstrate that this method has very fast convergence using first-order optimization algorithms such as L-BFGS, with near-linear scaling to million-degree polynomials.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the problem of line spectral estimation in the continuum of a bounded interval with one snapshot of array measurement. The single-snapshot measurement data are turned into a Hankel data matrix which admits the Vandermonde decomposition and is suitable for the MUSIC algorithm. The MUSIC algorithm amounts to finding the null space (the noise space) of the adjoint of the Hankel matrix, forming the noise-space correlation function and identifying the s smallest local minima of the noise-space correlation as the frequency set. In the noise-free case exact reconstruction is guaranteed for any arbitrary set of frequencies as long as the number of measurement data is at least twice the number of distinct frequencies to be recovered. In the presence of noise the stability analysis shows that the perturbation of the noise-space correlation is proportional to the spectral norm of the noise matrix as long as the latter is smaller than the smallest (nonzero) singular value of the noiseless Hankel data matrix. Under the assumption that the true frequencies are separated by at least twice the Rayleigh Length (RL), the stability of the noise-space correlation is proved by means of novel discrete Ingham inequalities which provide bounds on the largest and smallest nonzero singular values of the noiseless Hankel data matrix. The numerical performance of MUSIC is tested in comparison with other algorithms such as BLO-OMP and SDP (TV-min). While BLO-OMP is the stablest algorithm for frequencies separated above 4 RL, MUSIC becomes the best performing one for frequencies separated between 2 RL and 3 RL. Also, MUSIC is more efficient than other methods. MUSIC truly shines when the frequency separation drops to 1 RL or below when all other methods fail. Indeed, the resolution length of MUSIC decreases to zero as noise decreases to zero as a power law with an exponent smaller than an upper bound established by Donoho.},

We propose a novel approach based on estimating derivatives of eigenfunctions and expansions of random functions into their eigenfunctions to obtain a representation for derivatives. In combination with estimates for functional principal component scores for sparse data, this leads to a viable solution of the challenging problem to recover derivatives for sparsely observed functions. We establish consistency results and demonstrate in simulations that the method is superior to alternative approaches (derivative estimation with random effects models based on B-spline bases, kernel smoothing, smoothing splines, or P-splines). Our study is motivated by an analysis of bidding histories for eBay auctions, for which bids are typically very sparse in the middle and somewhat more frequent near the beginning and end of an auction. We demonstrate the estimation of derivatives of price curves for individual auctions from the sparsely observed bidding histories and also derive a model-free first-order differential equation that applies in the case of Gaussian processes. This provides a data-driven dynamic model that we use to elucidate auction dynamics.},

We show that almost all sets of O(rd log\textasciicircum 6 d) Pauli measurements satisfy the rank-r restricted isometry property (RIP). This implies that M can be recovered from a fixed ("universal") set of Pauli measurements, using nuclear-norm minimization (e.g., the matrix Lasso), with nearly-optimal bounds on the error. A similar result holds for any class of measurements that use an orthonormal operator basis whose elements have small operator norm.

We provide a theoretical analysis to bound the approximation error. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed pairwise perturbation algorithms are easy to control and converge to minima that are as good as ALS.

However, in many models this object cannot be computed from first principles and needs to be inferred on phenomenological grounds or fitted to experimental data. Consequently, some uncertainty regarding its form and parameters is unavoidable; this in turn calls into question the accuracy of any theoretical predictions based on a given spectral density. Here, we focus on the spin-boson model as a prototypical open quantum system, and find two error bounds on predicted expectation values in terms of the spectral density variation considered, and state a sufficient condition for the strongest one to apply. We further demonstrate an application of our result, by bounding the error brought about by the approximations involved in the Hierarchical Equations of Motion resolution method for spin-boson dynamics.},

  abstract = {With their constantly increasing peak performance and memory capacity, modern supercomputers offer new perspectives on numerical studies of open many-body quantum systems. These systems are often modeled by using Markovian quantum master equations describing the evolution of the system density operators. In this paper we address master equations of the Lindblad form, which are a popular theoretical tool in quantum optics, cavity quantum electrodynamics, and optomechanics. By using the generalized Gell-Mann matrices as a basis, any Lindblad equation can be transformed into a system of ordinary differential equations with real coefficients. This allows us to use standard high-performance parallel algorithms to integrate the equations and thus to emulate open quantum dynamics in a computationally efficient way. Recently we presented an implementation of the transform with the computational complexity scaling as \$O(N\textasciicircum 5 log N)\$ for dense Lindbaldians and \$O(N\textasciicircum 3 log N)\$ for sparse ones. However, infeasible memory costs remain a serious obstacle on the way to large models. Here we present a parallel cluster-based implementation of the algorithm and demonstrate that it allows us to integrate a sparse Lindbladian model of the dimension \$N=2000\$ and a dense random Lindbladian model of the dimension \$N=200\$ by using \$25\$ nodes with \$64\$ GB RAM per node.},

  abstract = {Super-resolution is a fundamental task in imaging, where the goal is to extract fine-grained structure from coarse-grained measurements. Here we are interested in a popular mathematical abstraction of this problem that has been widely studied in the statistics, signal processing and machine learning communities. We exactly resolve the threshold at which noisy super-resolution is possible. In particular, we establish a sharp phase transition for the relationship between the cutoff frequency (\$m\$) and the separation (\$\textbackslash Delta\$). If \$m {$>$} 1/\textbackslash Delta + 1\$, our estimator converges to the true values at an inverse polynomial rate in terms of the magnitude of the noise. And when \$m {$<$} (1-\textbackslash epsilon) /\textbackslash Delta\$ no estimator can distinguish between a particular pair of \$\textbackslash Delta\$-separated signals even if the magnitude of the noise is exponentially small. Our results involve making novel connections between \{\textbackslash em extremal functions\} and the spectral properties of Vandermonde matrices. We establish a sharp phase transition for their condition number which in turn allows us to give the first noise tolerance bounds for the matrix pencil method. Moreover we show that our methods can be interpreted as giving preconditioners for Vandermonde matrices, and we use this observation to design faster algorithms for super-resolution. We believe that these ideas may have other applications in designing faster algorithms for other basic tasks in signal processing.},

  abstract = {The goal of digital quantum simulation is to approximate the dynamics of a given target Hamiltonian via a sequence of quantum gates, a procedure known as Trotterization. The quality of this approximation can be controlled by the so called Trotter step, that governs the number of required quantum gates per unit simulation time. The stroboscopic dynamics generated by Trotterization is effectively described by a time-independent Hamiltonian, referred to as the Floquet Hamiltonian. In this work, we propose Floquet Hamiltonian learning to reconstruct the experimentally realized Floquet Hamiltonian order-by-order in the Trotter step. This procedure is efficient, i.e., it requires a number of measurements that scales polynomially in the system size, and can be readily implemented in state-of-the-art experiments. With numerical examples, we propose several applications of our method in the context of verification of quantum devices: from the characterization of the distinct sources of errors in digital quantum simulators to determining the optimal operating regime of the device. We show that our protocol provides the basis for feedback-loop design and calibration of new types of quantum gates. Furthermore it can be extended to the case of non-unitary dynamics and used to learn Floquet Liouvillians, thereby offering a way of characterizing the dissipative processes present in NISQ quantum devices.},

Derivatives of the resulting empirical expressions are used to avoid solving differential equations when estimating parameters. Benefits and shortcomings of PDA were examined using a simple continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) model. Although PDA required considerably less computational effort than traditional nonlinear regression, parameter estimates from PDA were less precise. Sparse and noisy data resulted in poor spline fits and misleading derivative information, leading to poor parameter estimates. These problems are addressed by a new iterative algorithm (iPDA) in which the spline fits are improved using model-based penalties. Parameter estimates from iPDA were unbiased and more precise than those from standard PDA. Issues that need to be resolved before iPDA can be used for more complex models are discussed.},

Such equations represent changes in system outputs by linking the behaviour of derivatives of a process to the behaviour of the process itself. Current methods for estimating parameters in differential equations from noisy data are computationally intensive and often poorly suited to the realization of statistical objectives such as inference and interval estimation. The paper describes a new method that uses noisy measurements on a subset of variables to estimate the parameters defining a system of non-linear differential equations. The approach is based on a modification of data smoothing methods along with a generalization of profiled estimation. We derive estimates and confidence intervals, and show that these have low bias and good coverage properties respectively for data that are simulated from models in chemical engineering and neurobiology. The performance of the method is demonstrated by using real world data from chemistry and from the progress of the autoimmune disease lupus.},

Our goal is to decompose the given matrix into its sparse and low-rank components. Such a problem arises in a number of applications in model and system identification and is intractable to solve in general. In this paper we consider a convex optimization formulation to splitting the specified matrix into its components by minimizing a linear combination of the ℓ1 norm and the nuclear norm of the components. We develop a notion of rank-sparsity incoherence, expressed as an uncertainty principle between the sparsity pattern of a matrix and its row and column spaces, and we use it to characterize both fundamental identifiability as well as (deterministic) sufficient conditions for exact recovery. Our analysis is geometric in nature with the tangent spaces to the algebraic varieties of sparse and low-rank matrices playing a prominent role. When the sparse and low-rank matrices are drawn from certain natural random ensembles, we show that the sufficient conditions for exact recovery are satisfied with high probability. We conclude with simulation results on synthetic matrix decomposition problems.},

  abstract = {From the key composite quantum system made of a two-level system (qubit) and a harmonic oscillator (photon) with resonant or dispersive interactions, one derives the corresponding quantum Stochastic Master Equations (SME) when either the qubits or the photons are measured. Starting with an elementary discrete-time formulation based on explicit formulae for the interaction propagators, one shows how to include measurement imperfections and decoherence. This qubit/photon quantum system illustrates the Kraus-map structure of general discrete-time SME governing the dynamics of an open quantum system subject to measurement back-action and decoherence induced by the environment. Then, on the qubit/photon system, one explains the passage to a continuous-time mathematical model where the measurement signal is either a continuous real-value signal (typically homodyne or heterodyne signal) or a discontinuous and integer-value signal obtained from a counter. During this derivation, the Kraus map formulation is preserved in an infinitesimal way. Such a derivation provides also an equivalent Kraus-map formulation to the continuous-time SME usually expressed as stochastic differential equations driven either by Wiener or Poisson processes. From such Kraus-map formulation, simple linear numerical integration schemes are derived that preserve the positivity and the trace of the density operator, i.e. of the quantum state.},

Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique steady state are derived and applied to different physical models including two- and four-level atoms, (truncated) harmonic oscillators, composite and decomposable systems. It is shown how these criteria could be exploited in principle for quantum reservoir engineeing via coherent control and direct feedback to stabilize the system to a desired steady state. We also discuss the question of limit points of the dynamics. Despite the non-existence of isolated centers, open quantum systems can have nontrivial invariant sets. These invariant sets are center manifolds that arise when the Bloch superoperator has purely imaginary eigenvalues and are closely related to decoherence-free subspaces.},

  abstract = {WavePacket is an open-source program package for the numerical simulation of quantum-mechanical dynamics. It can be used to solve time-independent or time-dependent linear Schrödinger and Liouville–von Neumann-equations in one or more dimensions. Also coupled equations can be treated, which allows to simulate molecular quantum dynamics beyond the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. Optionally accounting for the interaction with external electric fields within the semiclassical dipole approximation, WavePacket can be used to simulate experiments involving tailored light pulses in photo-induced physics or chemistry. The graphical capabilities allow visualization of quantum dynamics ‘on the fly’, including Wigner phase space representations. Being easy to use and highly versatile, WavePacket is well suited for the teaching of quantum mechanics as well as for research projects in atomic, molecular and optical physics or in physical or theoretical chemistry. The present Part I deals with the description of closed quantum systems in terms of Schrödinger equations. The emphasis is on discrete variable representations for spatial discretization as well as various techniques for temporal discretization. The upcoming Part II will focus on open quantum systems and dimension reduction; it also describes the codes for optimal control of quantum dynamics. The present work introduces the MATLAB version of WavePacket 5.2.1 which is hosted at the Sourceforge platform, where extensive Wiki-documentation as well as worked-out demonstration examples can be found. Program summary Program Title: WavePacket Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/tc5mrhx9sb.1 Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: Matlab Nature of problem: Schrödingerś equations are of fundamental importance in non-relativistic quantum mechanics of distinguishable particles. The solutions of the time-independent equation (TISE) are wavefunctions in coordinate space, the absolute squares of which are usually interpreted as probability density. The time-dependent equation (TDSE) describes the dynamics of a quantum system evolving in time. It plays a crucial role for the simulation, understanding, and prediction of modern experiments in atomic, molecular and optical physics where systems are driven by temporally shaped external fields. Solution method: All numerical methods compiled in WavePacket are based on discrete variable representations. Currently implemented are Gauss–Hermite, Gauss–Legendre and FFT-based schemes. The TISE is solved either by direct diagonalization or by propagation in imaginary time. For the TDSE there is a choice between second order differencing, operator splitting and Chebychev polynomial methods. Additional comments including Restrictions and Unusual features: The WavePacket program package is rather easy and intuitive to use, providing visualization of quantum dynamics ‘on the fly’. It is mainly intended for low-dimensional systems, typically not exceeding three to five degrees of freedom. Detailed user guides and reference manuals are available through numerous Wiki pages hosted at the SourceForge platform where also a large number of well documented demonstration examples can be found.},

  abstract = {This work presents a nonintrusive physics-preserving method to learn reduced-order models (ROMs) of canonical Hamiltonian systems. Traditional intrusive projection-based model reduction approaches utilize symplectic Galerkin projection to construct Hamiltonian ROMs by projecting Hamilton’s equations of the full model onto a symplectic subspace. This symplectic projection requires complete knowledge about the full model operators and full access to manipulate the computer code. In contrast, the proposed Hamiltonian operator inference approach embeds the physics into the operator inference framework to develop a data-driven model reduction method that preserves the underlying symplectic structure. Our method exploits knowledge of the Hamiltonian functional to define and parametrize a Hamiltonian ROM form which can then be learned from data projected via symplectic projectors. The proposed method is gray-box in that it utilizes knowledge of the Hamiltonian structure at the partial differential equation level, as well as knowledge of spatially local components in the system. However, it does not require access to computer code, only data to learn the models. Our numerical results demonstrate Hamiltonian operator inference on a linear wave equation, the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation, and a nonpolynomial sine–Gordon equation. Accurate long-time predictions far outside the training time interval for nonlinear examples illustrate the generalizability of our learned models.},

We then demonstrate that prefiltered least squares yields, to our knowledge, the first algorithm that provably estimates the parameters of partially-observed linear systems that attains rates which do not not incur a worst-case dependence on the rate at which these dependencies decay. The algorithm is provably consistent even for systems which satisfy the weaker marginal stability condition obeyed by many classical models based on Newtonian mechanics.

  abstract = {Recently, there has been significant progress in understanding the convergence and generalization properties of gradient-based methods for training overparameterized learning models. However, many aspects including the role of small random initialization and how the various parameters of the model are coupled during gradient-based updates to facilitate good generalization remain largely mysterious. A series of recent papers have begun to study this role for non-convex formulations of symmetric Positive Semi-Definite (PSD) matrix sensing problems which involve reconstructing a low-rank PSD matrix from a few linear measurements. The underlying symmetry/PSDness is crucial to existing convergence and generalization guarantees for this problem. In this paper, we study a general overparameterized low-rank matrix sensing problem where one wishes to reconstruct an asymmetric rectangular low-rank matrix from a few linear measurements. We prove that an overparameterized model trained via factorized gradient descent converges to the low-rank matrix generating the measurements. We show that in this setting, factorized gradient descent enjoys two implicit properties: (1) coupling of the trajectory of gradient descent where the factors are coupled in various ways throughout the gradient update trajectory and (2) an algorithmic regularization property where the iterates show a propensity towards low-rank models despite the overparameterized nature of the factorized model. These two implicit properties in turn allow us to show that the gradient descent trajectory from small random initialization moves towards solutions that are both globally optimal and generalize well.},

  abstract = {Characterizing the interactions and dynamics of quantum mechanical systems is an essential task in developing quantum technologies. We propose an efficient protocol based on the estimation of the time-derivatives of few qubit observables using polynomial interpolation for characterizing the underlying Hamiltonian dynamics and Markovian noise of a multi-qubit device. For finite range dynamics, our protocol exponentially relaxes the necessary time-resolution of the measurements and quadratically reduces the overall sample complexity compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, we show that our protocol can characterize the dynamics of systems with algebraically decaying interactions. The implementation of the protocol requires only the preparation of product states and single-qubit measurements. Furthermore, we improve a shadow tomography method for quantum channels that is of independent interest and discuss the robustness of the protocol to various errors. This protocol can be used to parallelize the learning of the Hamiltonian, rendering it applicable for the characterization of both current and future quantum devices.},

  abstract = {Parameter estimation for nonlinear differential equations is notoriously difficult because of poor or even no convergence of the nonlinear fit algorithm due to the lack of appropriate initial parameter values. This paper presents a method to gather such initial values by a simple estimation procedure. The method first determines the tangent slope and coordinates for a given solution of the ordinary differential equation (ODE) at randomly selected points in time. With these values the ODE is transformed into a system of equations, which is linear for linear appearance of the parameters in the ODE. For numerically generated data of the Lorenz attractor good estimates are obtained even at large noise levels. The method can be generalized to nonlinear parameter dependency. This case is illustrated using numerical data for a biological example. The typical problems of the method as well as their possible mitigation are discussed. Since a rigorous failure criterion of the method is missing, its results must be checked with a nonlinear fit algorithm. Therefore the method may serve as a preprocessing algorithm for nonlinear parameter fit algorithms. It can improve the convergence of the fit by providing initial parameter estimates close to optimal ones.},

  abstract = {tion problem, in which we wish to recover a (low-rank) data matrix from incomplete samples of its entries. A recent convex relaxation of the rank minimization problem minimizes the nuclear norm instead of the rank of the matrix. Another possible model for the rank minimization problem is the nuclear norm regularized linear least squares problem. This regularized problem is a special case of an unconstrained nonsmooth convex optimization problem, in which the objective function is the sum of a convex smooth function with Lipschitz continuous gradient and a convex function on a set of matrices. In this paper, we propose an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm, which terminates in O(1= p ) iterations with an -optimal solution, to solve this un- constrained nonsmooth convex optimization problem, and in particular, the nuclear norm regularized linear least squares problem. We report numerical results for solving large-scale randomly generated matrix completion problems. The numerical results suggest that our algorithm is ecient and robust in solving large-scale random matrix completion problems. In particular, we are able to solve random matrix completion problems with matrix dimensions up to 105 each in less than 3.5 hours on a modest PC.},

By contrast, we show that analytic continuation is far more ill-conditioned in a strip or a channel, with exponential loss of digits of accuracy at the rate exp(−π x/2) as one moves along. The classical Weierstrass chainof-disks method loses digits at the faster rate exp(−ex).},

In this paper, we identify a general class of non-Markovian memory kernels, described by complex-valued radon measures, and define their dynamics through a regularization procedure constructing the corresponding system-environment unitary groups. Building on this definition, we then consider \$k-\$local many-body non-Markovian systems with physically motivated assumptions on the total variation and smoothness of the memory kernels. We establish that their dynamics can be efficiently approximated on quantum computers, thus providing a rigorous verification of the Extended Church-Turing thesis for this general class of non-Markovian open quantum systems.},

To overcome the instability of numerical differentiation of the fitted function solely from the data or the prohibitive costs of solving the differential equation on the whole domain, we use the Gaussian processes to jointly model the solution, the derivatives, and the differential equation, by utilising the fact that differentiation is a linear operator. By regarding the linear differential equation as a linear constraint, we develop the Gaussian process regression with constraint method (GPRC) at Bayesian perspective to improve the prediction accuracy of derivatives. For nonlinear equations, we propose a Picard-iteration approximation of linearization around the Gaussian process obtained only from data to iteratively apply our GPRC. Besides, a product of experts method is applied if the initial or boundary condition is also available. We present several numerical results to illustrate the advantages of our new method and show the new estimation of the derivatives from GPRC improves the parameter identification with less data samples.},

  abstract = {The estimation of signal covariance matrices is a crucial part of many signal processing algorithms. In some applications, the structure of the problem suggests that the underlying, true covariance matrix is the Kronecker product of two valid covariance matrices. Examples of such problems are channel modeling for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications and signal modeling of EEG data. In applications, it may also be that the Kronecker factors in turn can be assumed to possess additional, linear structure. The maximum-likelihood (ML) method for the associated estimation problem has been proposed previously. It is asymptotically efficient but has the drawback of requiring an iterative search for the maximum of the likelihood function. Two methods that are fast and noniterative are proposed in this paper. Both methods are shown to be asymptotically efficient. The first method is a noniterative variant of a well-known alternating maximization technique for the likelihood function. It performs on par with ML in simulations but has the drawback of not allowing for extra structure in addition to the Kronecker structure. The second method is based on covariance matching principles and does not suffer from this drawback. However, while the large sample performance is the same, it performs somewhat worse than the first estimator in small samples. In addition, the Cramér–Rao lower bound for the problem is derived in a compact form. The problem of estimating the Kronecker factors and the problem of detecting if the Kronecker structure is a good model for the covariance matrix of a set of samples are related. Therefore, the problem of detecting the dimensions of the Kronecker factors based on the minimum values of the criterion functions corresponding to the two proposed estimation methods is also treated in this work.},

  abstract = {An improved Prony method for online dynamic tracking of low-frequency oscillations (DTLFO) in wide-are measurement system (WAMS) is proposed in this paper. It employs the characteristic of singular value distribution of the sample matrix to identify a reduced-order signal model. Then, the corresponding linear-prediction parameters are worked out in sense of singular linear least square. The obtained low-order system retains the dominant swing modes of interest and exhibits modal characteristics similar to the unreduced system in frequency domain associated with swing modes. Digital simulations verify the accuracy, speed and robustness of the improved algorithm. In one of the latest commissioned WAMS project, i.e., Jiangsu provincial WAMS, this algorithm is implemented as an online application to dynamically track low-frequency power oscillation in real time. The captured oscillatory event demonstrates the feasibility and good performance of the algorithm. With the reduced-order system model identified using the improved Prony method, our next work is to develop an online adaptive damping control system based on wide-area measurements.},

  abstract = {We propose \$\textbackslash textsf\{ScaledGD(\$\textbackslash lambda\$)\}\$, a preconditioned gradient descent method to tackle the low-rank matrix sensing problem when the true rank is unknown, and when the matrix is possibly ill-conditioned. Using overparametrized factor representations, \$\textbackslash textsf\{ScaledGD(\$\textbackslash lambda\$)\}\$ starts from a small random initialization, and proceeds by gradient descent with a specific form of damped preconditioning to combat bad curvatures induced by overparameterization and ill-conditioning. At the expense of light computational overhead incurred by preconditioners, \$\textbackslash textsf\{ScaledGD(\$\textbackslash lambda\$)\}\$ is remarkably robust to ill-conditioning compared to vanilla gradient descent (\$\textbackslash textsf\{GD\}\$) even with overprameterization. Specifically, we show that, under the Gaussian design, \$\textbackslash textsf\{ScaledGD(\$\textbackslash lambda\$)\}\$ converges to the true low-rank matrix at a constant linear rate after a small number of iterations that scales only logarithmically with respect to the condition number and the problem dimension. This significantly improves over the convergence rate of vanilla \$\textbackslash textsf\{GD\}\$ which suffers from a polynomial dependency on the condition number. Our work provides evidence on the power of preconditioning in accelerating the convergence without hurting generalization in overparameterized learning.},

  abstract = {Alternating least-squares (ALS) is a simple yet effective solver for canonical correlation analysis (CCA). In terms of ease of use, ALS is arguably practitioners' first choice. Despite recent provably guaranteed variants, the empirical performance often remains unsatisfactory. To promote the practical use of ALS for CCA,  we propose truly alternating least-squares. Instead of approximately solving two independent linear systems, in each iteration, it simply solves two coupled linear systems of half the size. It turns out that this coupling procedure is able to bring significant performance improvements in practice. Inspired by accelerated power method, we further propose faster alternating least-squares, where momentum terms are introduced into the update equations. Both algorithms enjoy linear convergence. To make faster ALS even more practical, we put forward adaptive alternating least-squares to avoid tuning the momentum parameter, which is as easy to use as the plain ALS while retaining advantages of the fast version. Experiments on several datasets empirically demonstrate  the superiority of the proposed algorithms to recent variants.},

Numerical analytic continuation is considered to be an ill-posed problem where uncertainties on the Matsubara axis are aplified exponentially. Here, we present a systematic and controlled procedure that approximates any Matsubara function by a minimal pole representation to within a predefined precision. We then show systematic convergence to the exact spectral function on the real axis as a function of our control parameter for a range of physically relevant setups. Our methodology is robust to noise and paves the way towards reliable analytic continuation in many-body theory and, by providing access to the analytic structure of the functions, direct theoretical interpretation of physical properties.},

Characterization of the rate constant distribution is often critical for mechanistic understandings of these processes. However, it is difficult to extract a rate constant distribution from data measured in the time domain. This is due to the numerical instability of the inverse Laplace transform, a long-standing mathematical challenge that has hampered data analysis in many disciplines. Here, we present a method that allows us to reconstruct the probability distribution of rate constants from decay data in the time domain, without fitting to specific trial functions or requiring any prior knowledge of the rate distribution. The robustness (numerical stability) of this reconstruction method is numerically illustrated by analyzing data with realistic noise and theoretically proved by the continuity of the transformations connecting the relevant function spaces. This development enhances our ability to characterize kinetics and dynamics of biological processes. We expect this method to be useful in a broad range of disciplines considering the prevalence of complex exponential decays in many experimental systems.},
