The file FrontEnd.m contains all of the various parameters that the user can set. That file should be pretty self explanatory. The code assumes that you have the parallelization toolbox, and possibly also the statistics toolbox (I don't recall). There are two global variables in testEstimatorParallel.m that need to be set by the user: the directory where the data files will be stored (line 30), and the number of cores in which to run in parallel (line 33). Also, the function MakeGraphs.m assumes that the data can be found in the current directory in a folder called Data. Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause, but file i/o is annoying and time consuming, and it's quite possible that nobody will ever read this. :) The final figures for the paper were generated from the Mathematica notebook included in the Data folder.

Finally, I want to acknowledge Brielin Brown as a coauthor for some of the functions here, especially for the bulk of testEstimatorParallel.m and earlier versions of FrontEnd.m and MakeGraphs.m.
